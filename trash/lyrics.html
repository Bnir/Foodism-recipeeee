            Yeah, you!
            Yeah, you!
            I used to wanna be
            Living like there’s only me
            But now I spend my time
            Thinking ’bout a way to get you off my mind (Yeah, you!)
            I used to be so tough
            Never really gave enough
            And then you caught my eye
            Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike (Yeah, you!)

            Look at me now, I’m falling
            I can’t even talk, still stuttering
            This ground I’m on, it keeps shaking
            Oh-oh-oh, now!

            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you
            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you
            Everybody’s trying to be a billionaire
            But every time I look at you I just don’t care
            ‘Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you (Yeah, you! Hahaha)

            I used to run around
            I didn’t wanna settle down
            But now I wake each day
            Looking for a way that I can see your face (Yeah, you!)
            I’ve got your photograph
            But, baby, I need more than that
            I need to know your lips
            Nothing ever mattered to me more than this (Yeah, you!)

            Look at me now, I’m falling
            I can’t even talk, still stuttering
            This ground I’m on, it keeps shaking
            Oh-oh-oh, now!

            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you
            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you
            Everybody’s trying to be a billionaire
            But every time I look at you I just don’t care
            ‘Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you (Yeah, you!)

            Look at me now, I’m falling
            I can’t even talk, still stuttering
            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, you!)

            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you
            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you (Yeah, you!)

            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you
            All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you (Yeah, you!)

            Everybody’s trying to be a billionaire
            But every time I look at you I just don’t care (I just don’t care)
            ‘Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
            Is somebody to you (Somebody to you)

            ‘Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
            Is somebody to you (Yeah, you!)

            Yeah, you!
